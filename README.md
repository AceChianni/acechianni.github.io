# Ace Chianni's Portfolio

This began as a captone project to create a mock simple portfoliio in order to display my skills at level 1 of my full stack knowledge. I am now taking the time to utilize it as a true professional portfolio in order to help my transition into a more creative tech based role


## Capstone Project Description

My project is a simple portfolio layout using cards, carousels, and timelines to display the work that I've done and the journey I've been on to get to where I am today. It is just a clean design with some dynamic text and graphics utilizing some of the skills I've gathered today.

## Problem Statement

This project is used to showcase my skill and abilities in not only front end development, but eventually for all of the mediums of art and creativity that I utilize. It has been a main priority to create a portfolio, but I never knew how I wanted to go about it, so this assigment provided me with a great opportunity.

## Daily Reflections

### Day 1: [December 12]

#### Today's Progress

- Worked by hand to create some simple layouts for the options I had for what type of build I wanted to implement for this project.

#### Challenges and Blockers

- Some of the things I want to do may be beyond the scope of which we learned throughout the class

#### Learning and Insights

- I learned how to build a wireframe for a portfolio site as well as coming up with a colorscheme

#### Next Steps

- Beginning the project in VS code

---

### Day 2: [December 13]

#### Today's Progress

- Used the bootstrap documentation to create a nav bar and customize the colors to match my selected scheme. May choose to add a custom cursor

#### Challenges and Blockers

- Figuring out how to add my own personal images to the design has been a challenge. I am still not sure if I am doing it properly

#### Learning and Insights

- I learned how to go about creating a custom cursor for a webpage

#### Next Steps

- Finding different pieces of content to add to the site to make it more dynamic and interesting

---

### Day 3: [December 14]

#### Today's Progress

- Broke my code... a lot But I made a calculator for my hourly rates! Also added a contact me form

#### Challenges and Blockers

- creating the functions to calculate my hourly rate of pay for any projects, I had to utilize ChatGPT to help me fix a few of the bugs in the layout as well as getting the calculator to calculate

#### Learning and Insights

- I learned how to utilize chat gpt to help me with some of the smaller things as well as using it to double check some of the bugs in my code. putting them both in the same div did help with a lot of my formatting issues

#### Next Steps

- Work on the about me page

---

### Day 4: [December 15]

#### Today's Progress

- Worked on my about me page where i created a timeline and a table

#### Challenges and Blockers

- Getting my timeline to stay in its proper spot was the hardest part. Shifting the screen size between mobile and desktop view caused a lot of odd changes that I didnt want.

#### Learning and Insights

- I spent hours trying to find the best solution to get it all just how I wanted without breaking when the size changed. I also added a scroll bar which made it a lot easier to get it to remain proportinate in relation to the skills table

#### Next Steps

- Tightening up the content I do have as well as getting my landing page squared away

---

### Day 5: [December 16]

#### Today's Progress

- I am finally finished! I think. I walk away and come back to something else I want to tweak or change every few hours

#### Challenges and Blockers

- Positioning the text for the carousel beneath the photots instead of on top of them was my biggest issue. Also found another bug with my aboout me page dealing with the timeline and the table. Also, a hard time figuring out why my table cells are still white even though I changed the colors in CSS

#### Learning and Insights

-Padding and margins have been my best friends in getting everything to lay out smoothly. It's finally beginning to stick which one is for adjusting the containers versus the content within the containers.

#### Next Steps

- Tightening up any other loose ends I may have. Giving finial tweaks before uploading to Github

## Final Reflection

At the end of it all, this was a fun experience. I do want to play around more so I can eventually add my own photos from my actual projects, as well as creating a custom cursor. I am getting more comfortable in knowing the semantic elements which is great. I could have definitely made this a lot more dynamic and I do plan to revisit in the near future to add more styling to it as a whole. I got to import a Google font though which was great.
